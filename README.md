# pymacjoule

Python module to access power consumption, resource usage and other metrics via python without sudo. Will likely break in new macOS versions, currently tested on macOS 14, m3 max. All function calling code was copied from [macmon](https://github.com/vladkens/macmon) and adapted to work as a Python module, using PyO3.
